		var motiveParagraphs = ["Hey, you! Over there! Try out the game 'you left me'- you can download it, or, of course, watch other people play the game- I especially like Markiplier's view, quite inspiring. 'It's hard to sleep when your mind is at war with your mind'. Keep pushing, tiger! Figure out the meaning of the game, either from watching the video or playing the game itself (the video already 'shows' what it means, but there are multiple messages). Love you <3, I hope I get to see you for another day. Thank you for still living.", 

			"Hello, lovely person of the 7 billion of the world. YOU are 1 in a 7 billion. Want to know how big a billion is? 7 000 000 00. Oops, I'm sorry. I missed a zero. Here, 7 000 000 000. No one would be able to replace you, you're such a gem in this universe. If you did decide to leave this corrupt Earth, want to know how many peoples' hearts would shatter into pieces, just like glass? Tons- your family, your friends, your pets, everyone would miss you. I would miss you, forever. As I've stated before, we are very delicate, we can shatter in just mere miliseconds. You wanna know why this is the absolute lowest of lows? It's because the gods up above are wanting to give you a beautiful, carefree life- although it comes at a price. Only good things can happen when bad things happen, too. Like the rainbow after the thunderstorm. Nobody has the right to deny your values. YOU *ARE* the protagonist. Just live without pushing yourself too hard. Thank you for still living.", 

			"You're still here? C'mon! Go outside, take a walk- Wear a mask, protect yourself and family, then go clear your mind out. Agoraphobic? Lockdown? No problem! Go take a drink of water, write everything on a piece of paper or journal, and let all your feelings out. Everyone deserves a break of being the cheerful, happiest they could be, right? So just let it all out. Find new hobbies, distract yourself from your sufferings. Talk to someone, it doesn't matter if they are also dealing with depression, anxiety, anything, really. You guys will be able to go through this *together*. No one can deal with this villain all by themselves. I'm with you, too. I'm here with you, even if we live on different sides of the world. I hope you'll be able to live freely forever. Thank you for still living.", 

			"No one can truly understand your own pain. Although they still try to help. You will always be able to love better, as you will appreciate much more by staying in the darkness.  ", "", "", "", "", ]
